Home Automation

This is a simple prototype of Home Automation. 
I have used Node.JS for basic http server interactions, JQuery for ajax calls, HTML/HTML5, Bootstrap for frontend, and 
javascript. 
This application would require v6.9.1 version of Node.JS
This application can be run on Mozilla Firefox and Safari.
